# PostsDeck
As a way to teach myself Ruby on Rails, I created PostsDeck as my open source blogging platform. wesvance.com sits on top of PostsDeck and continues to host my blog and personal website and project showcase. One notable difference between PostsDeck and other blogging platforms is the tight integration with the Twitter & Mapbox API’s. Upon signing into Postsdeck through Twitter, a users tweets are pulled and displayed on a map. Similarly, new Postsdeck posts are also saved to a map of the posted location. This creates a unique connection between the blog creator and the followers!

I have attached a few of the views below.

Upon signing onto Postsdeck through Twitter, a user’s bio is pulled from the users Twitter description. A user can also add links to other popular media platforms such as; LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook as well as adding an email link.

A user can enter a blog post using markdown. Postsdeck can also highlight code in a blog post using standard syntax.
