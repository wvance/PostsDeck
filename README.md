# PostsDeck
As a way to teach myself Ruby on Rails, I created PostsDeck as my open source blogging platform. wesvance.com sits on top of PostsDeck and continues to host my blog and personal website and project showcase. One notable difference between PostsDeck and other blogging platforms is the tight integration with the Twitter & Mapbox APIâ€™s. Upon signing into Postsdeck through Twitter, a users tweets are pulled and displayed on a map. Similarly, new Postsdeck posts are also saved to a map of the posted location. This creates a unique connection between the blog creator and the followers!
